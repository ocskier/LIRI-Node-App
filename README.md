# LIRI-Node-App
An AI demo app using node.js


* [`liribot.js] (LIRI-Node-App/liribot.js)

### Instructions

* This is a node.js app for searching three API's

* The app generates a list of four choices using inquire module

* The user can select either to get his last up to 20 tweets by inputing his Twitter      username
   
* The user can select to get a songs info from Spotify by inputing the song name

* The user can select to get a movies info from OMDB by inputing the movie name

* The user can select to get info from any of the three APIs by selecting "do what it     says" choice and putting the command and there query info in the random.txt file

* If the user doesnt want to use LIRI just say no to confirm after list choice

* After any successful API query from a user selected choice the user can select to run LIRI again or quit

* The code for this can be found in my portfolio at                                       https://ocskier.github.io/My-Mat-Portfolio
